Test Plan
1. Run configure - should create a .configure file that has the IP address and Port#
    - this should be the very first command to be run, if another command was run before there 
      should be an error

2. Run create - should create a project in the server_repo and a .Manifest file for the project;
   should also send a copy back to the client

3. Run add - should add an entry to the file in the project's .Manifest

4. Run remove - should remove the entry of the given file from the .Manifest file

5. Run commit - should produce a .commit file if there are differences in the client and server
   Manifest.

6. Run push - the client will send the .commit and all files list in the commit to the server.

7. Run add/remove to change the client side then run update - should create a .update file on 
   client side, the client will also be outputting to STDOUT the differences

8. Run upgrade - Client will apply the changes in the .update file and the .update should be 
   deleted

9. Run history - should receive a file that contains all pushes done to the project

10. Run current version - client will output all files that the server has under the project and 
    their version numbers

11. Run rollback - the server will revert its current version to a previous version by deleting 
    all the more recent versions saved

12. Run destroy - server should delete all files within the project directory and the project
